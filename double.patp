ADD 11
LOAD 0
STORE 3
CLEAR
STORE 31

Doubles the input (left shift).
Does so by writing another add operation in the main
  store, so the addition is performed twice.
This has the side effect of giving the output an add
  operation, but shouldn't be problematic.
The only problematic operations to give results are
  JMP, BNZ, and STORE, with STORE only being
  problematic if it stores a JMP, BNZ, or makes
  a deactivated branch active.
